## What are mental disorders?

A mental disorder is characterized by a clinically significant disturbance in an individualâ€™s cognition, emotional regulation, or behavior.  It is usually associated with distress or impairment in important areas of functioning. (World Health Organization: WHO, 2019)

As a matter of fact, mental disorders are not as distant from our lives as we may imagine. It is very common for people to suffer from one or multiple mental disorders. More importantly, we should develop a healthy perception about them.

## Story of the data

The original csv. file is obtained from kaggle.com, which is from Atim (@amitd) at data.world. This dataset contains information from countries all over the world about the prevalence of mental health disorders from 1990 to 2017. ([Data source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/uncover-global-trends-in-mental-health-disorder))

The data reveals a general increasing trend in the prevalence of mental health disorders across various regions from 1990 to 2017. This shows that mental disorders are commonly seen and is becoming more of a threat to us.

Also, we can see some factors from comparison of different regions, such as economic strengths (developed vs developing countries) and population. Sometimes we can even see a drop in the percentage of people suffering from mental disorders, and that is because the overall population is growing faster than patients.
